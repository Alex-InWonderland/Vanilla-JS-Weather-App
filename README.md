# Vanilla JS App

This is a weather app, which takes a city and outputs the temperature in fahrenheit of the city that is typed in.

Note: 
In order to use this app, you will need to have your own OpenWeatherMap API key. This API key must then be passed into the apiKey variable located at the top of the app.js file.
